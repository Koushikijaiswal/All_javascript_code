/*

Algorithm of the Bubble Sort Algorithm
Assume the array is an n-element array. You also need to  assume that the function "switch" the values of the array elements given to it.

begin BubbleSortAlgorithm( Array )

For all the elements of the array

        if array[i] > array [i + 1]

            switch ( array[i] , array[i+!])

        end if

end for

return array

end BubbleSortAlgorithm

/*
The bubble sort algorithm is a reliable sorting algorithm. 
This algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n2).
 The bubble sort has a space complexity of O(1). 

 Why space complexity of bubble sort is 1?
The space complexity for Bubble Sort is O(1),
 because only a single additional memory space is required i.e. for temp variable.
